## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Full skill evaluation pipeline: classify, generate tests, execute, score, judge, decide (S022-S024)
- Three evaluation modes: new skill (UC-1), update existing (UC-2), overlapping capability (UC-3) (S024)
- Evaluator scorer with per-dimension and weighted composite scoring via ModelBackend judge operation (S022)
- Quality judge with pairwise comparison and prompt injection hardening via system/user separation and XML delimiters (S023)
- Evaluation manager orchestrator chaining classify → generate → execute → score → judge → decide (S024)
- Test suite generator and persistence layer extracted from CWB, adapted to OWB's LiteLLM ModelBackend (S024)
- Skill type classifier with 10 skill types and configurable weight vectors (S028)
- Organizational layer classifier (L0-L3) with few-shot examples from YAML and confidence-gated manual review (S028)
- Trust tier assignment from registry-loaded policies with data-driven tier transitions (T0/T1/T2) (S029)
- Multi-source content discovery with per-source glob patterns, exclude rules, and SourcesConfig (S035)
- Repo-level security audit with pass/warn/block verdicts for hooks dirs, setup scripts, event triggers (S036)
- `owb update <source>` command replacing hardcoded ECC update path with config-driven multi-source pipeline (S037)
- SourcesConfig in config.py for named upstream sources with repo URL, pin, and discovery rules (S035)
- 251 new tests (374 → 625)

### Changed
- `owb ecc update` preserved as backward-compatible alias for `owb update ecc` (S037)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- Config-driven architecture with three-layer overlay system (defaults, user file, CLI flags) (S040)
- LiteLLM-backed ModelBackend for model-agnostic provider routing — works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, and any LiteLLM-supported provider (S041)
- Extensible registry system for security patterns, trust policies, and marketplace formats with metadata envelopes and overlay support (S042)
- Interactive setup wizard (`owb init`) with 7-step configuration: model provider, API keys, vault tiers, marketplace format, security patterns, trust policies (S043)
- Vault config generation from existing vaults (`owb init --from-vault <path>`) (S043)
- `--no-wizard` flag to skip interactive setup and use defaults (S043)
- VaultConfig.assistant_name for configurable generated content (S044)
- AgentConfigConfig with configurable directory and filename (defaults: `.ai/WORKSPACE.md`) (S044)
- EccConfig.enabled flag (default: false) and configurable target_dir (S044)
- PathsConfig with runtime resolution from CLI name
- CLI name-aware config resolution (`owb` uses `~/.owb/`, `cwb` uses `~/.cwb/`)
- ModelsConfig with per-operation model strings for classify, generate, judge, security_scan
- SecurityConfig, TrustConfig, MarketplaceConfig as first-class config sections
- 42 security patterns split into 9 registry files with metadata envelopes
- Trust tier policy file (T0/T1/T2) in registry format
- Marketplace format configs (generic, anthropic, openai) in registry format
- `config.example.yaml` documenting full schema
- 121 new tests (253 to 374)

### Changed
- VaultConfig.parent_dir default changed from "Claude Context" to "Context" (S044)
- ECC installation disabled by default (enable via config) (S044)
- Agent config deploys to `.ai/WORKSPACE.md` by default (configurable) (S044)
- Security scanner accepts SecurityConfig and Registry for pattern loading
- Semantic analysis uses ModelBackend instead of direct anthropic SDK (S041)
- Scanner accepts ModelBackend instead of api_key/model parameters (S041)
- All Claude-specific references in generated content replaced with configurable assistant_name (S044)

### Removed
- Direct `anthropic` SDK dependency (replaced by LiteLLM)
- Hardcoded Claude-specific paths and content in engine modules

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- CLI entry point (`owb`) with Click-based commands: init, diff, migrate, ecc update/status, security scan
- Config module with defaults-first strategy and optional YAML overlay
- Build engine: vault generator, ECC installer, skills installer, context deployer
- Three-layer security scanner: structural validation, pattern matching, semantic analysis
- Reputation ledger with threshold-based drop recommendations
- Workspace diff engine and interactive migration
- ECC upstream update workflow with fetch, diff, scan, accept/reject
- 253 tests
